## Building and Running a Project in SAS ESP Studio

SAS ESP Studio allows you to test a project.

1.	Ensure the project is open in SAS ESP Studio.

2.	If necessary, click <img src='../../images/save_icon.png'> to save your changes. A project must be saved before it can be tested.

3.	Click <img src='../../images/enter_test_mode_button.png'> to open the Test window.
	        
4.	Click <img src='../../images/run_test_button.png'> to begin the test. The project will start on the server and any connectors will begin publishing and subscribing. In this example, we are not using connectors, but rather publishing data directly from the studio according to the instructions [here](https://gitlab.sas.com/IOT/tutorials/ESP-tutorials/how-to-use-the-transpose-window#run-project-and-load-data)
   
5.	Once the project is running, and data has been published into ESP, click any of the tabs to view the output from the various windows.

6.	To stop the test, click <img src='../../images/stop_button.png'>.

## Enable Logging on the SAS ESP Server

If you receive an error or the connectors cannot start when you test a project, you can enable logging on the SAS ESP Server to view the messages from the log.

1.	Click **ESP Servers** to display the ESP Servers screen.

2.	Click the ESP Trial Server entry to select it, and then click <img src='../../images/properties_button.png'> to open the properties for the server.

3.	Click **Enable logging on the ESP server** and then click **OK**.

4.	Run the test again with logging enabled.
